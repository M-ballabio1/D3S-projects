### DeepLearning Projects

#### 1. Neural Network on MNIST Dataset
           First projects with a neural network using GPU on my personal computer.
           The result is excellent because the MNIST dataset is an academic dataset born to 
           learn how to model ML and DL.


#### 2. Deep Learning project (Computer Vision) - CNN for classification mushrooms:
           This is my first experiment with a neural network and certainly there will be a lot to work on,
           but this is my first job.
           I have created a CNN network for the classification of mushrooms in 5 possible categories. 
           Subsequently, with a graphical interface called Gradio I was able to verify the ability to 
           generalize on images different from those of the training dataset. The result is the following:
           
##### Accuracy: 0.8335 - val_accuracy: 0.7791

           The result reveals that the model has a slight overfitting problem, as the accuracy on the 
           training set > accuracy on the validation set. However, this being the first test I can be quite 
           satisfied to have obtained a val_accuracy of 77.91%.
